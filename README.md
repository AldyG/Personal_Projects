Hello everyone! <br>
My name is Ivan Aldy Ganesen.<br>
I'm currently a third year student majoring in Information Systems and Technology (IST) at Bandung Institute of Technology.<br><br>

Sometimes, when I have a little bit of free time, I used to do various activities, ranging from data science, doing competitive programming questions, and develop some sort of program to ease my college workload.<br>
So I thought, it wouldn't do much harm if I share my work here.<br>
<i> After all, I'm also in the process of learning. </i>
